NLP_and_DL_practic
===
This repo contains tutorials covering understanding and implementing NLP related Model.  
And it has some common requirements in below for implementing this Model.  

## **Requirements**##  
```bash
-python-3.7.9  
-pytorch==1.7.0+cu101  
-torchtext==0.3.1  
-spacy==2.2.4  
```

*This pratice implementation is referenced to [Convolutional Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/4%20-%20Convolutional%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb).Besides original notebook's Convolution Model,we create extened Model using RNN_layer and traditional ML model,and on top of that we testing different type hyperparmeter tuning for create Model.
